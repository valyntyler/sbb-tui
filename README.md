## ❓ Why

> I travel 4 hours a day and often work from the train, passing through remote regions of Switzerland where loading the SBB website alone can take up to an entire minute before I've even had a chance to search for my next connection (back when I started building this, my cellular data plan provided me with 500kb/s at most in the city). On top of that, I love open source and disliked handing data over to corporations unnecessarily, so I loved the idea of a faster solution that only fetched the necessary data, the one I requested. One day, while exploring the idea of building my first TUI, I stumbled upon the incredible [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/docs.html) and I knew I'd found the perfect occasion to start!
