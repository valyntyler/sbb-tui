# SBB-TUI

TUI client for Switzerland's public transports timetables, inspidered by the SBB/CFF/FFS [app](https://www.sbb.ch/).

# ❓Why

> I often work in the train, passing through remote regions of Switzerland where I'll have to wait up to an entire minute to finally be able to load the SBB website/app and get the much needed information about my next connection (I have a cheap cellular data subscription). Someday I fell onto the incredible [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch/docs.html) and decided it was the perfect occasion to learn how to create TUIs.

# 📦 Install

```sh
# homebrew
brew tap necrom4/homebrew-tap && brew install sbb-tui
# or go
go install github.com/necrom4/sbb-tui
```

# 🚀 Usage

1. Run `sbb-tui`
2. Input **departure** and **arrival** locations (navigate with `tab`).
3. Add optional information such as **date**, **time**, and **whether** those are for departure or arrival.
4. Press `Enter` to view the results (navigate with arrows).
